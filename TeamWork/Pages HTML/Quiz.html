                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="1" /> I guess I'd just go get food and find shelter, and that sort of thing. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="10" /> I'd wanna explore! <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="5" /> I'd probably go look for some friends... <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="7" /> Heh. I'd try out my battling skills. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="8" /> Just sleep, I guess. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="12" /> I'd take the chance to study up on and learn all about Pokemon from their level! <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="14" /> Gonna go hunt some Ninetales. She's gonna be No-tails soon. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="11" /> ...Implying it would be any different? I'd find some way to still be on the computer! <br />

                <li>
                <b>You just saw some other Pokemon in the area. How do you react to them?</b><br />

                <input type="radio" name="q11" value="9" /> I'd just walk away... Don't want to deal with it. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q11" value="12" /> I'd run, not walk. I'm not good with people. ...Or Pokemon as the case may be. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q11" value="13" /> I'd probably just watch from afar. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q11" value="6" /> I'd probably watch from a distance, but I'd be secretly hoping they saw me and talked to me... <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q11" value="2" /> Obviously I'd go up to them. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q11" value="4" /> I'd march up to them and introduce myself! <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q11" value="15" /> Who needs introductions? I'd just glomp them straight away! :D <br />
                </li><br />
                <li>
                <b>Suddenly the other wild Pokemon get into a fight! It's your first time seeing a battle from a Pokemon's point of view; how does it make you feel?</b><br />
                <input type="radio" name="q12" value="2" /> This is invigorating! <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q12" value="6" /> It's cool, but kinda scary to see from a Pokemon's point of view. <br />

                <input type="radio" name="q27" value="16" /> Release me, then. You'll be better off anyway. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q27" value="11" /> It's not a big deal; Luxray simply needs to attend a Pokemon Center. Please, calm down. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q27" value="14" /> You're going to release me? Sweet jesus has mercy, YES! <br />

                <input type="radio" name="q28" value="11" /> Well, he has a lot left to learn. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q28" value="5" /> Uh, he's a good person... But I feel sorry for Luxray and Gothita. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q28" value="3" /> He means well, he simply lacks the maturity to act effectively. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q28" value="6" /> I feel like kill me now. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q28" value="15" /> I can help him be better! He just needs more MAGIC in his life! :D <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q28" value="17" /> If it hasn't already been made clear, I think he's an idiot. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q28" value="8" /> There are better trainers out there, but I'd rather not be alone... <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q28" value="14" /> I hope he falls off a cliff and dies. <br />

                <input type="radio" name="q29" value="9" /> Gothita will shut up, or I will shut her up. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q29" value="5" /> I'd comfort her! Poor thing is scared and confused; she needs a friend. <br />

                <input type="radio" name="q29" value="16" /> I'm done. I'll leave without another word. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q29" value="10" /> I'd leave, but I'd offer Gothita to come with me. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q29" value="11" /> I'd talk with Gothita and explain what's going on. Maybe I'd work with her to help her feel better. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q29" value="14" /> We can talk smack about Elliot while he's gone, and it might cheer her up! >:D <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q29" value="13" /> I would simply insist that she trust in her Trainer. <br />

Elliot's calmed down, and the two of them get to talking.

                <input type="radio" name="q30" value="12" /> A new Trainer! I'd be excited, but nervous... <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q30" value="5" /> I'm not concerned about myself... If I'm gone, who will look out for Gothita? <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q30" value="15" /> New friends! But I'll miss Elliot a lot. Q~Q <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q30" value="7" /> Although Elliot is a poor standard, I worry about Brian's effectiveness as well. <br />

                <b> It's been a few days since you've been with Brian. He's a much more stable, mature Trainer, but his methods are very different from Elliot's. All of his Pokemon go through a daily routine of specific repetitions and technique-focusing exercises. For instance, Skarmory is to practice its Brave Bird attack's accuracy by landing the move exactly on a target 30 times in a row. You later find out that this is part of what is called EV Training. Brian is very strict about it, and you can't seem to make any progress with your excercises. How do you feel about Brian's training?</b><br />
                <input type="radio" name="q31" value="6" /> This is brutal! x.x Send me back to Elliot! <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q31" value="8" /> This is repetitive and useless and annoying and I hate it. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q31" value="3" /> It may be tedious, but I'm sure that in the long run, it'll be worth it. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q31" value="13" /> I will do as I am told. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q31" value="10" /> I refuse to partake in this rubbish! <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q31" value="4" /> The training was fun! ...At first... Now? I quit. <br />
                <input type="radio" name="q31" value="14" /> If this doesn't start producing some results soon, I'm running away. <br />
